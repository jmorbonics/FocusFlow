      <p>
        Welcome to our chatbot benchmarking platform, where we compare the
        performance of leading Large-Language-Models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT and Llama. This is 
        where future development will be done on developing interesting new features 
        related to chatbots. This includes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models,
        multimodal models, in-house data analytics, and more. Head over to the OpenAI page to 
        check it out!
