        <p>
          Welcome to our chatbot benchmarking platform, where we compare the
          performance of leading Large-Language-Models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT and Llama. This is 
          where future development will be done on developing interesting new features 
          related to chatbots. This includes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models,
          multimodal models, in-house data analytics, and more. Head over to the OpenAI page to 
          check it out!

          - Make sure to use a VPN like OpenVPN when accessing the website<br></br>
          - Don't worry if it takes some time to answer your question, the AI is working hard!<br></br>
